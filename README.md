# **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Deep Learning**  

A real-time Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system that uses webcam input and deep learning to classify human actions. This project provides a visually enhanced interface for better user experience.  

---

## **Features**  
- 🎥 **Real-Time Detection**: Classifies activities in real-time using webcam input.  
- 🧍 **Pose Tracking**: Leverages MediaPipe for pose landmark extraction.  
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Integration**: Uses TensorFlow for activity classification.  
- 🖼️ **Enhanced Interface**: Displays bounding boxes around face and body with activity labels.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, Pillow  

---

## **Usage**  
- Launch the program by running the main script, and the webcam will activate automatically.  
- The system will detect and classify human activities in real-time.  
- Activities such as "walking," "running," or "dancing" will be displayed with a bounding box around the detected person and activity label.  
- Quit the program anytime by pressing the `q` key.

## **Applications**  
- 🏋️ **Fitness Monitoring**: Track workout activities and provide feedback for posture correction or performance improvement.  
- ✋ **Gesture Control**: Enable hands-free interaction with devices by recognizing specific gestures or movements.  
- 🔒 **Surveillance Systems**: Monitor predefined activities or detect anomalies for security and safety purposes.  
- 🎓 **Educational Tools**: Teach and demonstrate physical exercises or movements interactively.  
- 🤖 **Human-Robot Interaction**: Use activity recognition for controlling robots or smart devices based on detected actions.
